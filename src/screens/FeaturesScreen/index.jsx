            The app is equipped with licenced therapists that are available for
            the students to chat with in the event the student needs an
            additional layer of support. The system issues push notifications to
            suggest behavioural changes, activities, and positive messaging to
            help improve the overall mental well-being of the user.

            LITH is also using the social network concept to boost personal
            growth and to make it more centralized to solve mental health
            issues. Unlike any other mental health apps, LITH has support groups
            moderated by our A.I systems to provide maximum support for the
            studentâ€™s mental health.
